WEB335-A337 Introduction to NoSQL (2215-DD)
This course introduces the core concepts of non-relational database structures. Topics include
Key/Value pairs, Table Structures, Data Types, Access Controls, and NoSQL queries.
Relational databases (MySQL) are explored to contrast the capabilities of non-relational to
relational database structures. Python will be introduced as a tool for database interface.
